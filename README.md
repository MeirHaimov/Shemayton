# Shmython - A Lightweight Python-like Interpreter üêç
Shmython is a simple yet powerful interpreted language inspired by Python, designed for educational purposes and light scripting. Built with Python, it features a custom lexer, parser, and interpreter to demonstrate core concepts of language implementation.
**Key Features ‚ú®**
Python-like Syntax - Familiar structure with variables, loops, conditionals, and functions

- Rich Standard Library

- Math: MIN(), MAX(), SQUARE()

- String Operations: CONCAT(), ISUPPER(), SPLIT(), REPLACE()

- Data Structures: ARRAY, TUPLE with APPEND, REMOVE, SORT_TUPLE

- Error Handling - Clear diagnostics for common errors

**Advanced Features**

- Index access for arrays/tuples

- Nested loops & conditionals

- Type conversion automations

- String interpolation support

**Installation & Usage üì•**
git clone https://github.com/MeirHaimov/Shemayton
cd shmython
python interpreter.py

**Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è**
- Lexical Analysis - Custom tokenizer

- Syntax Parsing - Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generation

- Runtime - Object-based interpreter

- Error Recovery - Graceful handling of syntax/type errors

**Ideal For üí°**
- Learning compiler/interpreter design

- Lightweight scripting needs

- Prototyping language features

- Educational environments
